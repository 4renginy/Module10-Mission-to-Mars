# Module10-Mission-to-Mars;

Robin had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to create web app to include all four of the hemisphere
images. 
<br> 
To do this, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, to store the scraped data on a Mongo database. Then  use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

Mission to Mars ipynb is the starting point we started the scrapping from web, with the help from this file we created the scrap.py file. This file will give us 
Mars info, weather, and hemisphares. Scraping this will just place them into our database what we need to do now is to present it in a meaningul way. We will create an html index file so show online.
